# React Divergence Meter

I was bored so made this I guess.

```bash
yarn add react-divergence-meter
```

```js
import Divergence from "react-divergence-meter";

const Usage = () => (
    <Divergence
        value="0.0001"
        // Value can be any string of numbers, spaces or decimal points
    />
);

export default Usage;
```

Images shamelessly stolen from [a rainmeter skin](https://old.reddit.com/r/steinsgate/comments/3a1kqy/desktop_divergence_meter_clock_rainmeter_skin/) which probably stole them from Steins;Gate itself.
